Probabilistic model for Brain MRI segmentation using deep learning algorithms
Project description- 
To propose an efficient deep learning method for brain tumor segmentation using MR Images, which effectively identifies different types of brain tumors.
To design a Model capable of improving the performance of segmentation of tumor in heterogeneous tissue region.

Proposed Model-


The proposed word of the process of identification and classification of the brain tumor image is of three folds.
In order to mention it in the sequential order, the probabilistic U-Net is being employed in the image segmentation process and feature extraction. 
The process flow of the research work which is being proposed, defining the tri-fold process of detecting and classifying the brain tumor.

Technologies used-


Computer simulation and image processing techniques, Combination of feature extraction techniques and deep learning to extract more detailed information, 
CNNs can automatically extract features without manual feature extraction, U-Net is a powerful model for medical image segmentation, CNN for brain tumour classification.
